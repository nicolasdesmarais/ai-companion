              &quot;Sharing&quot; and &quot;Selling&quot; Information.{" "}
            </span>
            The CCPA requires businesses that &quot;sell&quot; personal
            information, as the term &quot;sell&quot; is defined under the CCPA,
            to provide an opt-out from such sales. Some people have taken the
            position that when a website uses third parties&apos; cookies or
            similar technology for its own analytics or advertising purposes,
            the website is engaged in a &quot;sale&quot; under the CCPA if the
            third parties have some ability to use, disclose or retain the data
            to improve their service or to take steps beyond the most narrowly
            drawn bounds of merely providing their service to the website/app.
            Some take this position even when the website pays the third party
            (not vice versa), and in most cases merely provides the third party
            with an opportunity to collect data directly, instead of providing
            personal information to the third party. As part of these analytics
            and advertising services, these technologies may access identifiers
            (like IP addresses), internet or other electronic network activity
            information (like information regarding an individual&apos;s
            browsing interactions on our Site), and commercial information (like
            the fact that a browser visited a page directed to people who are
            considering purchasing the AI Marketplace) to those sorts of
            companies. While we do not believe these are &quot;sales&quot; as
            that term is defined under the CCPA, you can opt out of this
            activity by visiting this link: Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal
            Information. The CCPA also requires businesses that
            &quot;share&quot; personal information to provide an opt out from
            such sharing. Under the CCPA,&quot; sharing&quot; is defined as the
            targeting of advertising to a consumer based on that consumer&apos;s
            personal information obtained from the consumer&apos;s activity
            across websites. We &quot;share&quot; information for these purposes
            to provide more relevant and tailored advertising to you regarding
            the AI Marketplace. As part of this advertising, we may
            &quot;share&quot; identifiers (like IP addresses and email
            addresses), internet or other electronic network activity
            information (like information regarding an individual&apos;s
            browsing interactions on our Site), and commercial information (like
            the fact that a browser visited a page directed to people who are
            considering purchasing the AI Marketplace) with advertising
            platforms and advertising networks. To opt out of such
