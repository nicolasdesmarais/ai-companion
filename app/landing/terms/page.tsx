          maintain, develop, and improve the AI Marketplace, comply with
          applicable law, enforce our terms and policies, and keep the AI
          Marketplace safe. AppDirect will not use your Content to train its
          artificial intelligence models without your consent. However, certain
          providers of the third-party large language models we offer may use
          your data to train their models. When you use those third-party
          large-language models or an AI Bot that uses those models, you consent
          to the model provider&apos;s use of your Content for model training
          and other uses as described in their terms of service and privacy
          policy. We encourage you to review these providers&apos; terms of
          service and privacy policies before using their large language models

          Intelligence.Artificial intelligence is still a developing field.

          and the AI Marketplace may provide similar output to other users; The
          results you receive from the AI Marketplace may not always be
          accurate, so you should not rely solely on those results, or use
          results as a substitute for professional advice; You must evaluate
          Output for accuracy and appropriateness for your desired use
          (including reviewing the Output by a human as appropriate) before
          using or sharing Output; You may not use any Output relating to a
          person for any purpose that could have a legal or material impact on
          that person, such as making credit, educational, employment, housing,
          insurance, legal, medical, or other important decisions about them;
          Output does not represent AppDirect&apos;s views and does not
          constitute an endorsement of any third party product or service. For

          upload to or include with your AI bot (for example the bot name,
          instructions, and description) (&quot;Bot Content&quot;) is your
          Content. As between you and AppDirect, you are solely responsible for
          your Bot Content and configurations that you use or enable to create
          your AI bot as well as any Output that is based on your Bot Content
          and configurations. You must ensure your AI bot complies with these
          Terms and any applicable policies. Distribution and Promotion of AI
          bots.By sharing your AI bot with others, you grant a nonexclusive,

          and otherwise make available to other users all or any part of your AI
          bot (including Bot Content), subject to any access controls you have
          set when configuring your AI bot; and (ii) to the extent Output from
          your AI bot includes your Bot Content, to users of your AI bot to use,
          store, copy, display, distribute, prepare derivative works of and
          otherwise use your Bot Content. You will ensure that all information
          that you publish about your AI bot is, at all times, complete,
          accurate, and not misleading. Disclosures.Where your AI bot uses a
          third party large language model whose developer uses Content for its
          own model training, you are responsible for providing any disclosures
          and obtaining any consent from your bot users for such training, as
          required by applicable law. You are also responsible for any required
          disclosures and consents prior to permitting your bot user to use your
          AI Bot to take Actions (defined below). Actions.The AI Marketplace may
          permit you to enable features allowing your AI bot to access external
          websites or take certain actions off of the AI Marketplace
          (&quot;Actions&quot;). You are entirely responsible for your AI
          bot&apos;s Actions, and for ensuring you have all rights and

          AppDirect is identified as the builder of an AI bot, AI bots are
          created by other users, and they may rely on content or third party
          applications, including third party large language models, that are
          not controlled by AppDirect. AI bots may also take Actions on websites
          or other properties not controlled by AppDirect. The presence of an AI
          bot on the AI Marketplace does not imply that AppDirect created,
          supports or endorses the AI bot. Only use AI bots that you know and
          trust. Under no circumstances will AppDirect be liable for any AI bots
          created by other users, the AI models that those AI bots employ, any
          Actions, or any Content. This includes, but is not limited to,
          infringement of intellectual property rights, errors or omissions in
          any content, use of your Content for third party model training, and
          any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any
          such content. Abuse Reporting.You can report AI bots that violate
          ourUsage Policiesby contacting us at privacy@appdirect.com. Changes

          your country of residence. APPDIRECT&apos;S AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS,

          shall constitute a waiver of any prior, concurrent, or subsequent
          breach of the same or any other provisions hereof, and no waiver shall
          be effective unless made in writing and signed by an authorized
          representative of the waiving party. Trade Controls.You must comply
